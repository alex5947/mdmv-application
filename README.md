Thank you for using our micro-donations and micro-volunteering platform. This application serves two user classes: the charity organization members and the regular users. Charity organization members can use our website to post donation requests as well as post volunteer events for their specific cause. And in general as a regular user, you can view all donation and volunteer opportunites and make donations/sign-up for organizations that interest you. Once launched, the first thing to do is to login with google. Once logged in, you can either select the donations or volunteer pages to begin exploring. Your actions will be recorded on the home page, so make sure to check it regularly. Feel free to be as generous and outgoing as you would like on the platform!

For test donation payments:
  Use the fake card number: 4242 4242 4242 4242
  Enter any future date and five digit zipcode.
